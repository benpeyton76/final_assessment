# **Individual Self-Assessment**

## **Self-Assessment:**

Throughout the course of the final project, I contributed and worked on building a website that a user could use to make predictions of NCAA College Football games based on historical half time stats. I spent most of my time using HTML to construct the site to put a face on our project. I found that incorporating a machine learning model into an interactive site, made from scratch, was a bit more advanced than I anticipated. Although failing to build the vision, I was able to lay groundwork on possibly working on this project in the future, not to mention learning more advanced HTML techniques. I also tried to add HTML components to our dashboard, but my machine would not allow dash to run properly due to installation errors that could not be resolved in the amount of time we had.

## **Team-Assessment:**

As a team, I felt that there were no communication issues. Everything was clear and concise. We were able to exchange ideas and had our initial machine learning model up and running within 24 hours of creating our objective. I was thoroughly impressed with the way that our team was able to communicate with each other, the openness to suggestion, and the speed in which we were able to implement our idea. I feel that we could introduce this to almost anyone and it would be well received.

## **Summary Of Project:**

This project was conceived on the notion that the average American likes to gamble on sporting events. We decided to use a model that would take into account college football stats at the half and predict the winner of the game. After refining our dataset, we used the logistic regression classifier to test the accuracy of our model. We found that, after narrowing down our features, the model was approximately 76% accurate. With addition of more data such as more yearly stats, and added features such as type of turf or weather, we could make this model more accurate.
